# Seated dumbbell press

1. Grab a couple of dumbbells and sit on a military press bench or a utility bench that has a back support on it as you place the dumbbells upright on top of your thighs.
2. Clean the dumbbells up one at a time by using your thighs to bring the dumbbells up to shoulder height at each side.
3. Rotate the wrists so that the palms of your hands are facing forward. This is the starting position.
4. As you exhale, push the dumbbells up until they touch at the top.
5. After a one second pause, slowly come down back to the starting position as you inhale.

You can perform the exercise standing or sitting on a regular flat bench.
