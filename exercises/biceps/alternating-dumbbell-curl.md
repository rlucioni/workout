# Alternating dumbbell curl

1. Stand (torso upright) with a dumbbell in each hand held at arms length. The elbows should be close to the torso and the palms of your hand should be facing your thighs.
2. While holding the upper arm stationary, curl the right weight as you rotate the palm of the hand until facing forward. At this point continue contracting the bicep as you breathe out until your bicep is fully contracted and the dumbbells is at shoulder level. Hold the contracted position for a second as you squeeze the bicep. Only the forearms should move.
3. Slowly begin to bring the dumbbell back to the starting position as your breathe in. Remember to twist the palms back to the starting position (facing your thighs) as you come down.
4. Repeat the movement with the left hand. This equals one repetition.

There are several variations for this movement. You can perform the exercise sitting down on a bench with or without back support. You can also perform it using both arms at the same time. Additionally, you can perform it with a starting position in which both palms are facing forward.
