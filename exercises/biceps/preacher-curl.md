# Preacher curl

1. To perform this movement you will need a preacher bench and an E-Z bar. Grab the E-Z bar at the close inner handle. The palm of your hands should be facing forward and they should be slightly tilted inwards due to the shape of the bar.
2. With the upper arms positioned against the preacher bench pad and the chest against it, hold the E-Z bar at shoulder length. This is the starting position.
3. As you breathe in, slowly lower the bar until your upper arm is extended and the biceps are fully stretched.
4. As you exhale, use the biceps to curl the weight up until your biceps are fully contracted and the bar is at shoulder height. Squeeze the biceps hard and hold this position for a second, then slowly lower the bar.

You can perform this exercise using a low pulley with an E-Z Bar attachment instead. In this case, you will need to position the bench in front of the pulley. You may also use a wider grip for variety.
