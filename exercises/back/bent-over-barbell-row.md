# Bent over barbell row

1. Holding a barbell with a pronated grip (palms facing down), bend your knees slightly and bring your torso forward by bending at the waist while keeping the back straight until it is almost parallel to the floor. Keep your head up. The barbell should hang directly in front of you as your arms hang perpendicular to the floor and your torso. This is your starting position.
2. While keeping the torso stationary, breathe out and lift the barbell to you. Keep the elbows close to the body and only use the forearms to hold the weight. At the top contracted position, squeeze the back muscles and hold for a brief pause.
3. Inhale and slowly lower the barbell back to the starting position.

Not recommended for people with back problems; a low pulley row is a good alternative. As with the bent knee dead-lift, avoid back injury by ensuring perfect form and never slouching the back forward. Be careful with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more.
