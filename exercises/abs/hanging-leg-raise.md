# Hanging leg raise

1. Hang from a chin-up bar with both arms extended at arms length in top of you using either a wide grip or a medium grip. The legs should be straight down with the pelvis rolled slightly backwards. This is your starting position.
2. Raise your legs until the torso makes a 90-degree angle with the legs. Exhale as you perform this movement and hold the contraction for a second or so.
3. Go back slowly to the starting position as you breathe in.

Perform this exercise slowly and deliberately. Learn how to balance yourself so that you avoid swinging your torso. As you get more advanced you can hold a dumbbell in between your feet. Be careful adding weight to this exercise; hernias are bad.

This exercise can also be performed using a vertical bench. This makes the exercise easier, supporting your upper back and allowing you to hold yourself by placing your elbows and arms on the side pads.
