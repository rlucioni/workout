# Decline crunch

1. Secure legs at the end of the decline bench. Lie down.
2. Place hands lightly on either side of your head. Keep your elbows in. Don't lock your fingers behind your head.
3. Push the small of your back down in the bench to better isolate your abdominal muscles. Begin to roll your shoulders off of it.
4. Continue to push down as hard with your lower back as you contract your abdominals and exhale. Your shoulders should come up off the bench only about four inches, and your lower back should remain on the bench. At the top of the movement, contract your abdominals hard and keep the contraction for a second. Focus on slow, controlled movement; don't cheat yourself by using momentum.
5. After the one second contraction, come down slowly again to the starting position as you inhale.

Can be performed with weights, on top of an exercise ball, or on a flat bench.
